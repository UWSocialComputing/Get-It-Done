Welcome to the Get It Done Bot, made by team Get It Done! We've created a Discord bot to help students work more efficiently in group projects.

You can also check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/get-it-done-code) for our code, and you can use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1106299423883005982&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot) to invite the bot to one of your Discord servers!

*Disclaimer: the bot may not be running, as we've yet to host the bot on a platform like Heroku.*
